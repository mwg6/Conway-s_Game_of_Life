Simple visualizer of Conway's Game of Life. 

Rules are cells die if:
  there are more than XX cells sorrounding them
  there are fewer than XX cells sorrounding them
Cells come to life if:
  Three cells around them are alive

For each new game (currently) cells are randomly distributed on the board. Patterns will emerge through generations.
